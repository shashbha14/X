kind of like
so called
all of a sudden
out of the blue

by the way

if I’m honest
now and then
even though
for instance
in my opinion
in other words
to put it simply
in a way
on the whole
as far as I know
I guess
it seems
actually speaking
you might say
as far as I’m concerned
generally speaking
on the contrary
to my mind
as it happens
on the other hand
in the end
for the most part
in particular
to be precise
in a nutshell
in other words
just a minute
let me think
one way or another
